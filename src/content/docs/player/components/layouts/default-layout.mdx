description: A guide on how to setup the default audio/video layout and available customization options.

import MediaPlayer from '~/components/players/lazy-media-player.svelte';

The Default Layout ships with support for audio, video, and live streams. You can include both
layouts at the same time, only one will be matched depending on the view type.

::code[./usage]

By default, the view type is inferred from the provider and media type. You can specify the desired
type like so:

::code[./view-type]

The same is true for the [stream type][stream-type]:

::code[./stream-type]

[stream-type]: /docs/player/core-concepts/loading#stream-type

## Size

Both the audio and video layout will adapt to small containers to ensure an optimal user experience.
You configure when the small layout is displayed like so:

::code[./sm-layout]

If you'd like to disable small layouts, set the query to `false` or `'never'`:

::code[./disable-sm-layout]

## Icons

You can easily replace the icons used in the layouts to match the style of your application like
so:

::code[./icons]{copy=true}

::code[./provide-icons]

## Thumbnails

You can provide thumbnails which will be used to display preview images when interacting with
the time slider and in the chapters menu. See the [loading thumbnails][loading-thumbnails] guide
for more information.

::code[./thumbnails]

[loading-thumbnails]: /docs/player/core-concepts/loading#thumbnails

## Language

Both the audio and video layout support internationalization (i18n) by accepting custom language
translations. You can dynamically set the `translations` property to update the language like so:

::code[./language]{copy=true}
::code[./provide-language]

## CSS Variables

The following snippets contain a complete list of CSS variables and their respective default values.
They can all be adjusted by you to customize the audio/video layout and child components as desired.
