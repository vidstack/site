description: An overview on requesting and tracking fullscreen mode changes.

## Requesting

Requesting fullscreen has similar requirements to [autoplay policies][autoplay-policy]. In
general, it will not work programatically until the user has interacted with the document first,
or the request is in response to a user interaction like clicking or tapping a button. You can
request fullscreen changes by using the [`FullscreenButton`][fullscreen-button],
[remote control](#remote-control), or via [methods](#methods) on the player instance.

[autoplay-policy]: /docs/player/api/autoplay#autoplay-policy
[fullscreen-button]: /docs/player/components/buttons/fullscreen-button

### Remote Control

The [media remote][media-remote] provides methods for dispatching `media-enter-fullscreen-request`
and `media-exit-fullscreen-request` request events like so:

::code[./remote-control]

[media-remote]: /docs/player/core-concepts/state-management#updating

### Methods

The following `enterFullscreen()` and `exitFullscreen()` methods are available on the player
component instance for requesting fullscreen changes:

::code[./enter-method]{copy=true}
::code[./exit-method]{copy=true}

### Target

By default, calling the `enterFullscreen()` method will first attempt to use the
[Fullscreen API][fullscreen-api] so the custom media UI is displayed, otherwise it'll fallback to
the current media provider.

You can specify that you only want to display the provider in fullscreen and not the entire
media by specifying the fullscreen target like so:

::code[./target]

:::warning
By setting the target to `provider`, the player will only request fullscreen on the media provider,
meaning your custom UI will not be displayed when in fullscreen.

## State

The following fullscreen properties are available on the media store:

- `canFullscreen`: Whether fullscreen is supported by the current browser or provider.
- `fullscreen`: Whether the player is currently in fullscreen mode.

::code[./state]

## Styling

The following [media data attributes][player-data-attrs] are available for styling based on the
current fullscreen state:

::code[./styling]

[player-data-attrs]: /docs/player/components/core/player#mediaplayer.attrs

## Events

The following events are available for detecting fullscreen changes or errors:

::code[./events]

## Screen Orientation

You can specify the preferred fullscreen orientation like so:

::code[./orientation]

This will lock the screen orientation as specified by `fullscreenOrientation` while the media
enters fullscreen, and it will be unlocked while exiting. Keep in mind that this will only work
when the [Screen Orientation API][screen-orientation-api] is available. See the
[screen orientation][screen-orientation] page for more information.
