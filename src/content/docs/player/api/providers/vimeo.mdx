This provider is used to embed video content hosted on [Vimeo][vimeo] via
the [IFrame API][vimeo-iframe]. Out of the box you can enjoy the following benefits over the native
embed:

- Preconnections for faster rendering.
- Automatically loading titles and posters.
- Complete control of loading using [load strategies][load-strategy]. Lazy by default (only loaded when in view).
- Autoplay failure detection.
- No cookies by default for GDPR-compliance.
- Vimeo Pro detection for configuring playback speed and quality.
- Access to all of [Vidstack Player features][player-features].
