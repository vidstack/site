description: This provider enables playing videos hosted on YouTube via embeds.
---

This provider is used to embed video content hosted on [YouTube][youtube] via
the [IFrame API][yt-iframe]. Out of the box you can enjoy the following benefits over the native
embed:

- Preconnections for 224x faster rendering (using the same technique as [lite-youtube-embed][lite-yt-embed]).
- Automatically discovering and loading [WebP][webp] posters, falling back to JPG.
- Complete control of loading using [load strategies][load-strategy]. Lazy by default (only loaded when in view).
- Autoplay failure detection.
- No cookies by default for GDPR-compliance.
- Ugly recommendations popup is hidden when using custom controls.
- Access to all of [Vidstack Player features][player-features].
