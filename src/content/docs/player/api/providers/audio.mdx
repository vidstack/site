## Sources

**Single Source**

::code[./source]

**Multiple Sources**

::code[./multiple-sources]

**Source Object**

The src property on the player accepts any of the following source objects: `MediaStream`, `MediaSource`,
`Blob`, and `File`. You can optionally specify it's an audio object by setting the
source `type` to `audio/object`.

::code[./source-object]

### Source Types

The audio source URL should include on the following file extensions: **m4a, m4b, mp4a, mpga, mp2, mp2a,
mp3, m2a, m3a, wav, weba, aac, oga, spx.**

If the source URL **does not** contain a file extension, you must provide one of the following
type hints: **audio/mpeg, audio/ogg, audio/3gp, audio/mp4, audio/webm, audio/flac, audio/object.**

:::yes
The following are valid as they have a file extension (e.g, .mp3) or type hint (e.g., audio/mp3):
:::

- `src="https://example.com/audio.mp3"`
- `src = { src: "https://example.com/audio", type: "audio/mp3" }`
